actionable, non-actionable should be same table since there will never be that many actionable ones if ppl actually store notes
- ie would still have one huge table

tags is separate table, allows for indexing tags of everything per user
- everything has tags

untouched:
    - all new things, have the ability to mark
    - i review this queue and put it in a bucket

actionable:
    ***- what will have happened to be able to check this off
        -- describe in past tense
    *** multi step
    ***- "Whats the next action"
        one-step only:
            - put in calendar
            - complete asap
        multiple steps:

non-actionable:
    - trash
    - someday/maybe
    - references (generic notes)


actionable has optional context thats needed
    - ie grocery store
