insert into stuff_manager_tag (value) values ('cannot_be_done_yet');

Next:
    - add sort_order query key to list_actions


design figure out:
    1. How to replace the "completed" folder on computer:
        - idea is to have optional form show up for completed tasks
            - can mark something as relevant for interviews
            - can add note for certain topic
                -- maybe show a autocomplete of file paths that I can add to

add general return type:
-- or maybe use one based on django idk

-- make all endpoints return id's -- simplifies types and less code

- add expected energy, start, end times and duration field to actions

# class DefaultResponseSchema(Schema):
#     message: str
#     data: any
