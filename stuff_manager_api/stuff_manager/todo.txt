insert into stuff_manager_tag (value) values ('cannot_be_done_yet');
CURRENT:
    - finish support for POST /api/actions so that it creates tags, adds to somedayMaybe etc
        -- add non-default tags and required contexts first
        -- then add list endpoints for various types of actions: somedayMaybe, next_actions, delegated, etc

Next:
    - setup endpoint for get everything associated with a project (actions and notes seperately)
    - then create endpoint to get all actions for a user
    - create all list endpoints so I can get a working frontend
        - for lists:
            - delegate
            - someday maybe
            - cannot be done yet

FIX:
    - api response for empty data ie lists when there are no data
        -- these fail pydantic

design figure out:
    1. How to replace the "completed" folder on computer:
        - idea is to have optional form show up for completed tasks
            - can mark something as relevant for interviews
            - can add note for certain topic
                -- maybe show a autocomplete of file paths that I can add to

add general return type:
-- or maybe use one based on django idk

-- make all endpoints return id's -- simplifies types and less code

- add expected energy, start, end times and duration field to actions
